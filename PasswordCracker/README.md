# PasswordCracker

My file paths need to be replaced with the file paths on your computer. This is a password cracker that attemps to crack 4 passwords from a text file.
The passwords are encrypted with either sha1, sha256, or md5. The first three passwords are taken from a list of the top 10000 passwords.
The final password is a random series of four digits ranging from 0-z. It is brute forced by the password cracker and printed for the user.
This program is written in one line and is very hard to understand, I'm going to leave in my file paths to make it easier for you to find where to replace them.
