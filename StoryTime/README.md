# StoryTime

StoryTime is the most basic language algorithm that tries to write its own English based off of data thats given to it. All it knows are the words from the files it reads, and the words that come before a given word. This algorithm is currently capped at 1000 words per generation. File paths will need to be replaced with ones on your computer.
